## 🌌 Why Galaxy Invaders?  

I’ve always been amazed by how complex building a scalable cloud-native stack can feel — almost like trying to invade another galaxy. After working in this space for a while, I realized there isn’t a clear, standardized way for companies to get started. Everyone seems to reinvent the wheel, making things harder than they need to be.  

That’s where Galaxy Invaders comes in. I’m designing a set of open-source templates to help companies build a strong, scalable cloud-native stack from day one. Whether it’s backend, mobile, frontend, or infrastructure, these templates aim to be a solid starting point for teams looking to embrace the cloud without getting lost in the void.  

## 🚀 What We’re Building  

- **Backend:** High-performance gRPC-based services with Go, ready to handle scale.  
- **Mobile:** Seamless integration with cloud APIs for modern mobile apps.  
- **Frontend:** Optimized Next.js templates for sleek, responsive web apps.  
- **Infrastructure:** Production-ready Terraform/Terragrunt configurations to deploy across multiple clusters, regions, and clouds.  

## 🌠 The Mission  

The goal is simple: make it easier for teams to build robust systems that scale across clusters, regions, and even multiple cloud providers — without the headache.  

## 🌍 Want to Contribute?  

Meaningful contributions are welcome! Please avoid trivial PRs like typos to boost your OSS stats. Right now, I’m focusing on reviewing code changes that help push this vision forward.
